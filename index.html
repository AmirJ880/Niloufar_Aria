          <h3>Language</h3>
          <p>I started learining English when I was a 7-year old kid. As far as I remember, my parents encouraged me to treat education seriously so that I would have the necessary skills to compete in society. They always told me that I should learn as many languages as I could. That's why I also started my journey to learn French. So I'm able to speak English and French fluently, while I'm proud of my mother language, "Persian".</p>

          <h3>Cooking</h3>
          <p>My passionate hobby is cooking. Besides cooking is an essential skill in every day life, it reduces my stress level. My family and friends always crave for my special pasta, which is made with beef and a home-made tomato sauce.</p>
